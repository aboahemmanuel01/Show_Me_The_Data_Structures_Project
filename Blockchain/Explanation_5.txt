The solution to this problem presents the class Linkedlist in which its method (add_block) updates the block.
As a result the add_block function occurs in a constant time and so its time complexity is O(1).
This same reasons applies to the space complexity as it allocates a single variable each time and so the total space complexity is O(n). 
Where n is the total number od elements in the linkelist.
